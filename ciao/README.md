# ciao

https://github.com/brotandgames/ciao

ciao checks HTTP(S) URL endpoints for a HTTP status code (or errors on the lower TCP stack) and sends a notification on status change via E-Mail or Webhooks.

It uses Cron syntax to schedule the checks and comes along with a Web UI and a RESTful JSON API.
